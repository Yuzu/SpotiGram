# Spotifier - A solution for keeping up to date w/ new artist releases!

The intention of this script is to notify a user via Telegram Bot if an artist they follow uploads anything new!

# Background
Instead of notifying you of new releases now, Spotify has implemented their "Release Radar", a playlist updated every Friday with new releases. However, this doesn't quite meet the needs of people who would like to be notified of new releases. 
When set to run on, say, a daily basis, this script will check for new releases by a user's followed artists and notify them. 

# Dependencies

* spotipy
* Python 3.0+
* A Telegram Bot
* Some way to run the script periodically
* A Spotify Developer Client App
